        <hr>
            <h4>Birthday!</h4>
                <p>I was born on April 26th 2007 in an hospital that was maybe in Arizona(not the most sure tbh)</p>
            <h4>Family!</h4>
                <p>I have a pretty messy family, I have 3 brothers, 2 older, one younger. I also have a little sister. My eldest brother is dylan, my mom's nephew and by law my cousin, but he's my brother. The second eldest is Micheal, my dad's kid from his first marriage, and my quarter brother I, he was from my dad's last marriage but im not my dads biological child. I have my younger brother Sam, my mom and dad's child and technically my half-brother, and a younger sister Hannah, also like 1/4th sibling as Micheal's blood sister. My biological father is out of the picture and has been since I was one, his name is Mike. My dad is my adoptive father, while not legally adopted he's the man who reaised me since before I can remember. My mom is Nancy, a lovely woman and great mother.</p>

                    <h3>Cats</h3>
            <ul>
                 <li>Tigger - A very rotund tabby cat who was the runt of his litter, he got his name from the hopping tiger from Winnie The Pooh because he used to jump around as a kitten. (Alive)</li>
                <li>George - A half blind short tailed cat who once took a ride in my dad's truck, in the engine, hence the shortened tail and half blindness, he feels awful over her getting hurt in his truck and is his baby. (Alive)</li>
                <li>Loki - A very muscular tabby who likes to get into mischief and trouble, hence the name. (Alive)</li>
                <li>Thor - Loki's very fluffy grey and white brother, who seems to get into just as much trouble as his brother despite his namesake. (Alive)</li>

                    <h3>Misc.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Round Table - I don't remember all of the parakeets names but one was named Morganna and another was Arthur I think. Morganna murdered the other parakeets before dying. (All Deceased)</li>
                <li>Lee Roy JENKINSSSSS - My crested gecko named after a popular World Of Warcraft(?) joke because she(thought she was a boy until later down the line she laid eggs!) leaped straight onto my leg the first time I was going to handle her and scared me half to death, she also bit me once or twice and freaked me out. Sadly she fell into a depression not being able to have babies and starved herself to death. (Deceased)</li>
                <li>Poseidon - A temporary companion, I found a painted turtle while swimming getting smacked up against rocks, we found another mother turtle deceased on the shore before we had gone swimming and this baby turtle had a messed up back leg, he is currently liing at my house until I can find somewhere I can give him to that will take good care of him. (Alive)</li>
                <li>The Hares - once upon a time we had, they were a little mean from what i remember but adorable, saldy my brother "developed an allergic reaction" to them so we had to give them away. (Unknown Likely Deceased)</li>
                <li>The Rodents - Even further back once upon a time land I had hamsters, they were pretty rude though and i dont really remember them. (Unknown Likely Dead)</li>
