            <h4>Birthday!</h4>
                <p>I was born on April 26th 2007 in an hospital that was maybe in Arizona(not the most sure tbh)</p>
            <h4>Family!</h4>
                <p>I have a pretty messy family, I have 3 brothers, 2 older, one younger. I also have a little sister. My eldest brother is dylan, my mom's nephew and by law my cousin, but he's my brother. The second eldest is Micheal, my dad's kid from his first marriage, and my quarter brother I, he was from my dad's last marriage but im not my dads biological child. I have my younger brother Sam, my mom and dad's child and technically my half-brother, and a younger sister Hannah, also like 1/4th sibling as Micheal's blood sister. My biological father is out of the picture and has been since I was one, his name is Mike. My dad is my adoptive father, while not legally adopted he's the man who reaised me since before I can remember. My mom is Nancy, a lovely woman and great mother.</p>
